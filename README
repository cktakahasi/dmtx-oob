Testing guidelines
=====================

Assuming that dmtx symbol contains device info in predefined xml format this
dmtxplugin-front  client can:
- decode the symbol into text/xml file
- parse bluetooth device address from that file
- make a call to dmtx plugin gdbus interface
- print status in consle

Test Steps:
Step #1 
Create a dmtx symbol using dmtxwrite:
- Get your device's bluetooth address (hcitool scan)
- Modify bdaddr value in file sample-btinfo.xml
- Run command: dmtxwrite -o sample-btinfo.png sample-btinfo.xml

Step #2 Optionally test if symbol decode actually works
by running: dmtxread  sample-btinfo.png

Step #4 Compile and run dmtx plug-in enabled bluetoothd obtained from bluez-oob 
git@github.com:writefaruq/bluez-oob.git 


Step #5
Run this tool: ./src/dmtxpluginfront ../sample-btinfo.png

This should show device creation or any other messages


Planned Dmtxplugin-front
========================

Main tasks of this program are:
    1) Activated  by  incron interface upon creation of a dmtx symbol inside its data directory
    2) To decode this symbol into text file
    3) To call Dmtx-plugin server's D-Bus methods for creating devices
    4) To call Service D-Bus method to add services
    5) To Log activities



Main  modules:
=====================    
dmtxplugin-front.c
symbol.c     (task #2)
dmtxutils.c    (task #2)
dmtxplugin-gdbus.c    (task #3)
service-gdbus.c    (task #4)
